#Disaster detection via Twitter
Predictive classification model for determining if a Tweet is discussing a disaster event (i.e., building collapse, wildfire, terrorist attack)

Combining various Natural Language Processing tools an accurate Logistic Regression classifier is built to automatically identify a Tweet as a disaster or not. 

This tool may be freely used and improved upon (in fact this is encouraged). If any improvements on the model are found please let me know--as I would be interested in general and would like to link to the improved model and its description.
