  "body": "###1. Project summary\r\n---\r\n**Goal:** Create a predictive model to classify a tweet as pertaining to a disaster event or not, *solely* based on the tweet text.\r\n\r\n**Data:** 10,876 classified tweet entries in the \"Disasters on Social Media\" data set from CrowdFlower at http://www.crowdflower.com/data-for-everyone. Some examples of disasters include structural collapses, wildfires and terrorist attacks. However, this dataset also encompasses more \"minor\" events such as car accidents, etc. These were compiled by searching for tweets with disaster related keywords (i.e., hijacking, hurricane, and explosion) and then they were classified as \"Relevant\", \"Not Relevant\" or \"Can't Decide\" with \"Relevant\" indicating a disaster.\r\n\r\n**Machine learning tools** \r\n\r\n1. **Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK)** - For initial preprocessing and tokenization of tweets using the nltk.tokenize package.\r\n\r\n2. **GENSIM** - For seamless transformation from a high dimensional \"bag of words\" (BOW) feature space to a lower dimensional \"topic\" space (each topic expresses discovered relations amongst the words in the Tweet data set using Latent Semantic Indexing or LSI).\r\n\r\n3. **Scikit-Learn** - For trivial implementation the final Logistic Regression model which predicts \"disaster\" or \"not disaster\" based on each Tweets \"topic\" representation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n###8. Check out the \"topics\"\r\n---\r\n  1. Print out the top 10 topics with the top ten tokens they are composed of\r\n  2. Plot some topics against each other with colors to indicate class\r\n\r\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rjadrich/disaster_detection_via_twitter/master/data/cv_and_roc_data/cross_validation.png)",
